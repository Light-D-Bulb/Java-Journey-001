# Hourglass Sum

This repository contains a Java program that calculates the minimum sum of hourglasses in a 2D array.

## Program Description

The Java program takes input for the size of the square 2D array and the elements of the array. It finds the hourglass shapes present in the array and calculates the sum of each hourglass. The program then determines the minimum sum among all the hourglasses and outputs the result.

An hourglass shape in the array is defined as follows:

```
a b c
  d
e f g
```

## Program Logic

1. The program uses a Scanner object to read input from the console.

2. It gets the size of the array, creating an empty 2D array of the specified size.

3. The program reads the numbers from the console and stores them in the array.

4. It then iterates over the array to find the hourglass shapes. Starting from the top-left corner, it calculates the sum of each hourglass using the defined pattern.

5. The program keeps track of the minimum sum found among all the hourglasses by comparing it with the current sum.

6. Finally, it prints the minimum sum of any hourglass found in the array.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the Java file `HourGlassSum.java`.

2. Open the file in your preferred Java development environment.

3. Compile and run the Java file.

   ```
   $ javac HourGlassSum.java
   $ java HourGlassSum
   ```

   The program will prompt you to provide the size of the array and the elements to calculate the minimum sum of hourglasses.

## Example

### Sample Input:

```
3
1 1 1
0 1 0
1 1 1
```

### Sample Output:

```
Minimum sum of any hourglass: 4
```
